## Summary
- Noise check measures environmental sound using your device microphone. We do not run our own servers and do not collect, store, or share your personal data.
- Optional audio recordings you create stay on your device unless you export or share them yourself.
- Purchase information is handled by Google Play / App Store. We only keep a local flag that you bought Pro.

## Data we process
- Microphone audio: used in real time to calculate decibel levels and visualizations. Not sent to any server.
- Optional recordings: if you choose to record, files are saved locally in the app’s storage with level metadata for playback and history. You can delete them in your file manager or by uninstalling the app.
- Purchase status: a local setting (`isPro`) saved on the device to remember your upgrade.

## What we do **not** collect
- No account creation, email address, or profile data.
- No analytics, advertising identifiers, or location data.
- No server-side storage or sharing of your measurements or recordings.

## How we use data
- Real-time audio is processed on-device to show sound levels and frequency visuals.
- Optional recordings are stored locally so you can review or share them.
- Purchase events are used only to unlock Pro features.

## Sharing
- We do not share your data with third parties. If you export or share a recording, it is sent only where you choose.

## Permissions
- Microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`): required to measure sound and to make optional recordings.
- File access: recordings are stored in the app’s private storage. No broad file access is requested.

## Security and retention
- Data stays on your device. Uninstalling the app or deleting the recordings folder removes locally stored recordings and settings.

## Children
- The app is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information.

## Changes
- If this policy changes, we will update this document and the “Last updated” date.
